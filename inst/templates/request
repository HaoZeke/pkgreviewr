Dear `r params$reviewer_first_name`

Hi, this is {{{editor}}} from rOpenSci `r emo::ji("wave")`.

`r params$banter`

I'm writing to ask if you would be willing to review a package for rOpenSci. As you probably know, rOpenSci conducts peer review of R packages contributed to our collection in a manner similar to journals.

The package, {{{ Package }}} by `r {{{Authors@R}}}`, does:

> {{{Description}}}.


You can find it on GitHub [here]({{{URL}}}). We conduct our open review process via GitHub as well, [here]({{{issue_url}}})


If you accept, note that we ask reviewers to complete reviews in three weeks. (Weâ€™ve found it takes a similar amount of time to review a package as an academic paper.)

Our [reviewers guide] details what we look for in a package review, and includes links to example reviews. Our standards are detailed in our [packaging guide], and we provide reviewer [template] for you to use. If you have questions or feedback, feel free to ask me or post to the [rOpenSci forum].

{IF APPLICABLE: The authors have also chosen to jointly submit their package to the Journal of Open Source Software, so this package includes a short `paper.md` manuscript describing the software that we ask you include in your review.}

Are you able to review? If you can not, suggestions for alternate reviewers are always helpful. If I don't hear from you within a week, I will assume you are unable to
review at this time.

Thank you for your time.

Sincerely,

{{{editor}}}
